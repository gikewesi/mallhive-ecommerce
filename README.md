# Cloud-Native E-Commerce Platform: MallHive
## Overview 

MallHive is a cloud-native e-commerce platform designed to facilitate seamless transactions between buyers and sellers. It allows sellers to efficiently list and sell their products while enabling buyers to purchase items conveniently from their homes.
With modern AI-driven recommendations, buyers receive personalized product suggestions, enhancing their shopping experience.


## **1. Architecture Overview**

A cloud-native e-commerce platform built on a microservices architecture. The system is designed for scalability, high availability, and automation using GitOps and Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

### **Key Components:**
1. **Frontend Service:**
   - Framework: Flask (for lightweight UI) or Django (for full-featured UI).
   - Served via AWS CloudFront (CDN) for faster content delivery.
2. **User Service (Authentication & Profiles):**
   - REST API using Flask/Django (Python) for user management.
   - Secure password storage (e.g., bcrypt) and JWT authentication.
3. **Product Service:**
   - Built in Go for fast, concurrent handling of product catalog.
   - CRUD operations for products (with pagination and search).
4. **Order Service:**
   - Handles cart, order creation, and payment integration.
   - Built with Flask/Django for ease of development.
5. **Payment Service:**
   - External Payment Gateway integration (e.g., Stripe).
   - Secure payment handling and webhook support.
6. **Inventory Service:**
   - Manages stock levels and tracks product availability.
7. **Notification Service:**
   - Sends email/SMS notifications using AWS SNS and SES.
8. **Admin Dashboard:**
   - Provides analytics, order management, and inventory control.

## **2. Infrastructure Design**

### **AWS Services Used:**

| Service              | Purpose                               |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **EKS**             | Kubernetes cluster for microservices   |
| **AWS Fargate**     | Serverless container management       |
| **RDS**             | PostgreSQL for transactional data     |
| **S3**              | Product images and static content     |
| **CloudFront**      | CDN for UI and media                  |
| **AWS Secrets Manager** | Secure storage of sensitive data   |
| **AWS KMS**         | Encryption for sensitive information  |
| **ALB (Ingress)**   | Load balancing for services           |
| **CloudWatch**      | Logging and monitoring                |

### **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) - Terraform**
- Multi-region EKS clusters for redundancy.
- Auto-scaling groups for dynamic load handling.
- Secrets stored securely in AWS Secrets Manager.
- Automated backups for RDS and S3 versioning enabled.

## **3. Microservices Communication**

- **gRPC**: For internal microservice communication (high-speed, type-safe).
- **REST API**: For public endpoints (e.g., product search, user authentication).
- **Event-Driven**: AWS SNS for asynchronous notifications and event propagation.

### **Service-to-Service Security:**
- Use Kubernetes Network Policies to isolate services.
- Implement mutual TLS (mTLS) for secure service communication.

---

## **4. Deployment Pipeline (GitOps)**

### **GitHub Actions Workflow:**
1. **Linting & Testing:** Run unit tests and integration tests.
2. **Build & Package:** Containerize services using Docker.
3. **Push to Registry:** Store images in Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR).

### **ArgoCD Workflow:**
1. Monitor the Git repository for changes.
2. Deploy updates to Kubernetes.
3. Rollback on failure using ArgoCD health checks.

## **5. Security Best Practices**

1. **AWS Secrets Manager:**
   - Store and rotate database credentials securely.
2. **AWS KMS:**
   - Encrypt sensitive data (user PII, payment details).
3. **IAM Roles & Policies:**
   - Least-privilege access model.
4. **Kubernetes RBAC:**
   - Restrict user and service access.

---

## **6. Observability & Monitoring**

1. **Logging:**
   - Application logs with Fluent Bit to AWS CloudWatch.
2. **Metrics:**
   - Use Prometheus and Grafana for real-time monitoring.
3. **Tracing:**
   - Implement OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing.

---

## **7. Scaling Strategy**

1. **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA):**
   - Auto-scale microservices based on CPU/memory usage.
2. **Database Scaling:**
   - Read replicas for PostgreSQL to handle high read loads.
3. **CDN Caching:**
   - Cache static assets and APIs at CloudFront edge locations.

---

## **8. Disaster Recovery**

1. **Multi-Region Deployment:**
   - Failover-ready infrastructure in multiple AWS regions.
2. **Backups:**
   - Automated RDS snapshots and S3 versioning.
3. **Blue-Green Deployments:**
   - Zero-downtime deployments using ArgoCD.

---

## **9. Future Enhancements**

1. **Machine Learning Integration:**
   - Personalized product recommendations.
2. **Service Mesh:**
   - Implement Istio for advanced traffic management.
3. **Analytics Pipeline:**
   - Use AWS Kinesis and Athena for real-time insights.
